## Exercise 2: Create Dynamic Pricing Model

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a machine learning model that predicts the purchase price for an item sold by the vending machine, provided the demographics of the customer and the item. You will then operationalize this model by exposing it as a web service hosted in Azure Machine Learning, and test it out.

### Task 1: Create a model locally

1.  Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the **PricingModel** project and open the file **TrainModel.R** by double-clicking on the file in the Solution Explorer.

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expanded to: Solution \'VendingMachines\'\\PricingModel\\TrainModel.R.](./media/image73.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2.  Read the script. The top portion, entitled Create Sample Data, has been provided for you and you will generate the sample data you will use to train your model.

3.  Highlight all the text between the "Create Sample Data" and "END Create Sample Data" comments.

4.  Right-click the selected text and select Execute In Interactive. 
    
    ![Screenshot of the Train Model tab, with Execute In Interactive circled on the sub-menu.](./media/image74.png "Train Model tab")

5.  You should see it execute in the R Interactive Window, ending with a summary of the created data. 
 
    ![Screenshot of the R Interactive - Microsoft R Client window. ](./media/image75.png "R Interactive - Microsoft R Client window")

6.  From the R Tools menu, select Windows and Variable Explorer.
    
    ![Screenshot of the R tools menu, with Windows / Variable Explorer selected.](./media/image76.png "R tools menu")

7.  Expand the variable **sampleData**, and explore the structure of the created data.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Variable Explorer, with sampleData selected.](./media/image77.png "Variable Explorer")

8.  Now save this sampleData to a file by replacing TODO 1 in the TrainModel.R script with the following code:
    ```
    # TODO: 1. Export the sample data to a file   
    save(sampleData, file = "sampleData.RData")
    ```

9.  Highlight the **save line**, and select **Execute In Interactive**.

10. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location of the **PricingModel** (C:\\VendingMachines\\VendingMachines - Clean\\PricingModel) project on disk. **You should see** the file **sampleData.RData** on disk.

    ![Screenshot of File Explorer, with sampleData.RData selected, and the pop-up listing the Type (R Workspace), Size (2.85 KB), and Data/time modified.](./media/image78.png "File Explorer, sampleData.RData")

11. Back in the **TrainModel.R** file in Visual Studio, replace TODO 2 with the following code that builds the model using a Linear Regression.
    ```
    # TODO: 2. Build a linear regression model to predict purchase price given age, gender and # productSelect 
    pricingModel <- rxLinMod(purchasePrice ~ age + gender + productSelected, data = sampleData)
    ```

12. Save that trained model to disk by replacing TODO 3 with:
    ```
    # TODO: 3. Export the trained model to a file named pricingModel.rda 
    save(pricingModel, file = "pricingModel.RData")
    ```

13. Finally, save the first row of the sample data to a file so you can re-use the structure later when operationalizing the model. Replace TODO 4 with:
    ```
    # TODO: 4. Save one example of the sample data to serve as an input template, to a file     # called inputExample.rda
    inputExample <- sampleData[1,]
    save(inputExample, file = "inputExample.RData")
    ```

14. Save your changes to **TrainModel.R**.

15. Highlight TODO items 2 through 4 and execute them in interactive.

16. In the same folder as your script, you should now have the files **sampleData.RData**, **pricingModel.RData**, and **inputExample.RData**. 

    ![Screenshot of File Explorer, with the previously mentioned files circled.](./media/image79.png "File Explorer")

### Task 2: Try a prediction locally

1.  Within Visual Studio, open **PredictUsingModel.r** under the Pricing Model project in Solution Explorer.

2.  Replace TODO 1 with the following:
    ```
    # TODO: 1. Prepare the input to use for prediction
    inputExample[1,]$age <- 30
    inputExample[1,]$gender <- "F"
    inputExample[1,]$productSelected <- "coconut water"
    ```

3.  Replace TODO 2 with the following:
    ```
    # TODO: 2. Execute the prediction
    prediction <- rxPredict(pricingModel, data = inputExample)
    ```

4.  Highlight all the script in the file and execute it in interactive.

5.  Using Variable Explorer, expand the prediction variable and observe the price the model suggested to use for purchasing the coconut water for input of a 30-year-old female.
    
    ![Screenshot of Variable Explorer, prediction table. The purchasePrice\_Prec is 0.949.](./media/image80.png "Variable Explorer")

### Task 3: Create the model in R Server on HDInsight

1.  On your LabVM, open a Git Bash shell like you did in the [Before the Hands-on Lab, Task 4](#task-4-prepare-an-ssh-client), Step 7.

2.  SSH into your deployed R Server in HDInsight cluster. (You can get the SSH connection string for your cluster from the HDInsight Blade in the Azure Portal). 

    ![Screenshot of the HDInsight cluster blade for vendingmachineslab. Overview is selected in the left pane, and in the right pane, on the menu bar, Secure Shell (SSH) is circled.](./media/image81.png "HDInsight cluster blade")![Screenshot of Connect to cluster. Ssh.azurehdinsight.net is circled in the Hostname field, with the endpoint circled below.](./media/image82.png "Connect to cluster section")

3.  If prompted to continue connecting, enter yes.

4.  Enter your password.

5.  At the command prompt, type **R** to load the R shell (be sure to use a capital letter "R").

6.  Run the following command to create a spark context for R:
    ```
    sparkCluster <- RxSpark()
    rxSetComputeContext(sparkCluster)
    ```

7.  In Visual Studio, open **TrainModel.r**, and copy the entire script.

8.  Paste the script in the R shell, and press ENTER. (You may need to press ENTER a few times until you get to the last line of the script.)

9.  When the script has finished executing, type the following:
    ```
    dir()
    ```

10. You should see it list the three files created by the script, as follows:\
    ![Screenshot of a Visual Studio window listing the following three files: inputExample.RData, pricingModel.RData, and sampleData.RData.](./media/image83.png "Visual Studio ")

11. Now, copy those files from local storage to Blob storage by using the Hadoop File System. First, create a folder in which to store your output.
    ```
    modelExportDir <- "/models"
    rxHadoopMakeDir(modelExportDir)
    ```

12. List the contents of the root ("/") directory, and confirm your "**/models**" folder has been created. Notice that the list you are looking at is folders directly underneath the container in Azure Storage that was created with your cluster.
    ```
    rxHadoopListFiles("/")
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio window, with the previously mentioned information displaying, and the /models folder information circled.](./media/image84.png "Visual Studio window")

13. Copy the **pricingModel.RData** from the local directory to the **/models** folder in HDFS by running the following command:
    ```
    rxHadoopCopyFromLocal("pricingModel.RData", modelExportDir)
    ```

14. Repeat the previous step for inputExample.RData and sampleData.RData.

15. Run the following command to verify the three files now exist in HDFS (and Blob storage), under /models.
    ```
    rxHadoopListFiles("/models")
    ```

16. The output should look similar to the following:
    
    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio window with output verifying that the three files exist in HDFS.](./media/image85.png "Visual Studio window")

17. Using Visual Studio, Cloud Explorer, navigate to the storage account for your HDInsight cluster, expand: 

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio, Cloud Explorer expanded as: ivmlabstorage\\Blob Containers\\vendingmachineslab.](./media/image86.png "Visual Studio, Cloud Explorer")

18. Right-click the storage container, and select **Open.**

19. In the editor that appears, double-click the models folder, and verify you see your files.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Editor, hackathoncluster2(Container) tab. Under models/, three files display: inputExampleRData, pricingModelRData, and sampleDataRData.](./media/image87.png "Editor, hackathoncluster2(Container) tab")

20. Right-click **inputExample.RData** and select Save As... and choose the directory for your **PricingModel** project, overwriting files if prompted.

21. Repeat the previous step for **pricingModel.RData** and **sampleData.RData**.

22. You have now used R Server on HDInsight to train a model that you can then upload to R Server Operationalization to expose it as a web service.

### Task 4: Create predictive service in R Server Operationalization

After training a model, you want to operationalize the model so that it becomes available for integration by developers. One way to operationalize a trained model is to take the model you trained in HDInsight, and then to expose that as a predictive web service. In this task, you take a version of the scripts you have been running locally and in HDInsight and migrate them to run in the VM that is running R.

16. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Microsoft Machine Learning Server Virtual Machine you created in [Exercise 1, Task 3](#task-3-create-microsoft-machine-learning-server-on-linux).

17. On top of the Overview blade, select Connect, then copy the SSH command.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Overview blade top menu, which has Connect circled. In the section below, the ssh command ssh radmin\@52.168.132.221 is lighlighted.](./media/image47.png "Overview blade")

18. Using a new Git Bash window on your Lab VM, SSH into your Microsoft Machine Learning Server VM by pasting the SSH command you copied above at the command prompt. For example:
    **ssh radmin@\<your-server-ip\>.**

19. When prompted if you want to continue connecting, enter yes.

20. Enter your password, **Password.1!!**

21. At the prompt, after successfully logging in, you will need to complete a few tasks to configure and operationalize the environment.

22. Run the following command to act as root: **sudo -i**

23. Now that you are acting as root run the following command to: **az ml admin node setup \--onebox \--admin-password Password.1!! \--confirm-password Password.1!!**

    ![Command to setup ML server to host a webservice has been completed. the port 12800 is highlighted.](./media/image88.png)

24. In Visual Studio, open the **App.config** for the Simulator project. This can be done by expanding the Simulator project in the Solution Explorer, and double-clicking on **App.config** under the **Simulator** project. 

    ![The Visual Studio Solution Explorer has Simulator highlighted and expanded, and under it, App.config circled.](./media/image89.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

25. Locate the **appSetting** **rServiceBaseAddress** and enter **http://\<your-server-public-ip\>:12800** for the value. (For example: <http://52.168.132.221:12800>). Your server IP address is the same IP address you used for the SSH connection in Step 3 of this task, above.

26. Locate the **appSetting** **rServicePassword** and update its value with the password you defined when you configured your R server for Operationalization (step 11 above), **Password.1!!** 

    ![The App.config file for the project is open with the AppSettings for three keys shown. These include the URL to the server, user name and password.](./media/image90.png)

27. Save **App.config**.

28. Open **PredictPricingService.r** within the **PricingModel** project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

    ![The Visual Studio Solution Explorer has PricingModel expanded, and under it, PredictPricingService.r circled.](./media/image91.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

29. Find TODO 1, and replace with the following code block:
    ```
    # TODO: 1. Load packages needed for operationalization
    usePackage <- function(p) {
    if (!is.element(p, installed.packages()[, 1]))
    install.packages(p, dep = TRUE)
    library(p, character.only = TRUE)
    }
    usePackage("curl")
    usePackage("ggplot2")
    usePackage("mrsdeploy")
    usePackage("RevoScaleR")
    ```

30. Find TODO 2, and replace with the following code block to remotely connect to the R Server Operationalization service:
    ```
    # TODO: 2. Configure remote login
    remoteLogin(
    deployr_endpoint = "http://<your-server-ip>:12800",
    username = "admin",
    password = "<your-admin-password>"
    )
    pause()
    ```

**Note:** Make sure to replace **\<your-server-ip\>** with the IP address with your VM's IP address, and enter the password you specified when you configured your R server for Operationalization (step 11) in place of **\<your-admin-password\>**. The TODO 2 section should looking something like the following screen shot.

![Screenshot of the TODO 2 section, with the IP address and password circled.](./media/image92.png "TODO 2 section")

31. Highlight all the code in **PredictPricingService.r**, right-click and then **execute in interactive**. The last output status in the R Interactive window should be "Published service".

32. Find TODO 3 and replace with the following code block to consume the API as a test:
    ```
    # TODO: 3. Consume the API as a test
    services <- listServices("apiPredictPurchasePrice")
    serviceName <- services[[1]]
    api <- getService(serviceName$name, serviceName$version)
    result <- api$apiPredictPurchasePrice(30, "F", "coconut water")
    print("Result: ")
    print(result$output("answer"))
    result
    ```

33. Find TODO 4 and replace with the following code block to generate and save the Swagger JSON file for the API:
    ```
    # TODO: 4. Generate the Swagger JSON file for the API
    swagger <- api$swagger()
    cat(swagger, file = "swagger.json", append = FALSE)
    ```

34. Highlight just the TODO 3 and TODO 4 code blocks you added and execute in interactive.

35. When you scroll up through the R Interactive window results, you should see an output with your prediction like the following:
    ```
    $success
    [1] TRUE

    $errorMessage
    [1] ""

    $outputParameters
    $outputParameters$purchasePrice
    [1] 0.9348741
    ```

36. Also open the swagger.json file in your PricingModel project directory to view its contents. This file can be used within the swagger.io online editor to generate client code to connect to your service. We have already done this for you within the included IO.Swagger project.

## Exercise 3: Implement dynamic pricing

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement the code that performs dynamic pricing, capitalizing on the Face API to acquire demographics, and your deployed pricing model to suggest the price based on those demographics. You will then run the vending machine simulator and see the dynamic pricing in action.

### Task 1: Implement photo uploads to Azure Storage

1.  In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the Simulator project and then **MainWindow.xaml** and then open **MainWindow.xaml.cs**.

    ![Visual Studio Solution Explorer is expanded as: Simulator\\MainWindow.xaml\\MainWindow.xaml.cs.](./media/image93.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2.  Scroll down to the method **UpdateDynamicPricing**. 

    ![The UpdateDynamicPrice function is high-lighted in Visual Studio.](./media/image94.png)

3.  Replace TODO 1 with the following:
    ```
    // TODO 1. Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(_storageConnectionString);
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("photos");
    ```

4.  Replace TODO 2 with the following:
    ```
    // TODO 2. Retrieve reference to a blob named with the value of fileName.
    string blobName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + System.IO.Path.GetExtension(filename);
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(blobName);
    ```

5.  Replace TODO 3 with the following:
    ```
    // TODO 3. Create or overwrite the blob with contents from a local file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(filename))
    {
    blockBlob.UploadFromStream(fileStream);
    }
    ```

6.  Save MainWindow.xaml.cs.

### Task 2: Invoke Face API 

1.  Continuing with **MainWindow.xaml.cs**, scroll down to **GetBlobSasUri**. This method will create a Shared Access Signature URI that the Face API can use to securely access the image in blob storage. 

    ![The GetBlobSasUrl method is high-lighted in Visual Studio](./media/image95.png)

2.  Replace TODO 4 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO: 4. Create a Read blob and Write blob Shared Access Policy that is effective 5 minutes ago and for 2 hours into the future
    SharedAccessBlobPolicy sasConstraints = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy();
    sasConstraints.SharedAccessStartTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5);
    sasConstraints.SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(2);
    sasConstraints.Permissions = SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Write;
    ```

3.  Replace TODO 5 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO: 5. construct the full URI with SAS
    string sasBlobToken = blob.GetSharedAccessSignature(sasConstraints);
    return blob.Uri + sasBlobToken;
    ```

4.  With the SAS URI to the upload photo in hand, scroll to **GetPhotoDemographics** to implement the call to the Face API. 

    ![GetPhotoDemographics is high-lighted in Visual Studio.](./media/image96.png)

5.  Replace TODO 6 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO 6. Invoke Face API with URI to photo
    IFaceServiceClient faceServiceClient = new FaceServiceClient(_faceApiKey, _faceEndpoint);
    ```

6.  Replace TODO 7 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO 7. Configure the desired attributes Age and Gender
    IEnumerable<FaceAttributeType> desiredAttributes = new FaceAttributeType[] { FaceAttributeType.Age, FaceAttributeType.Gender };
    ```

7.  Replace TODO 8 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO 8. Invoke the Face API Detect operation
    Face[] faces = await faceServiceClient.DetectAsync(sasUri, false, true, desiredAttributes);
    ```

8.  Replace TODO 9 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO 9. Extract the age and gender from the Face API response
    double computedAge = faces[0].FaceAttributes.Age;
    string computedGender = faces[0].FaceAttributes.Gender;
    ```

9.  Save the file.

### Task 3: Invoke pricing model

1.  Within **MainWindow.xaml.cs**, scroll to the end of **UpdateDynamicPrice** and replace TODO 10 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO 10. Invoke the actual ML Model
    PricingModelService pricingModel = new PricingModelService();
    string gender = d.gender == "Female" ? "F" : "M";
    suggestedPrice = await pricingModel.GetSuggestedPrice((int)d.age, gender, _itemName);
    ```

2.  Save the file.

### Task 4: Configure the Simulator

1.  In the Simulator project, open **App.config**.

2.  Within the **appSettings** section, set the following settings (there were copied into a text edit previously):

    a.  **faceAPIKey**: set this to the KEY 1 value for your Face API as acquired from the Azure Portal.

    b.  **faceEndpoint**: set this to the ENDPOINT value for your Face API as acquired from the Azure Portal (for example: https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0)

    c.  **storageConnectionString**: set this to the connection string of the Storage Account you created with the photos container.

3.  Save the **App.config**. The updated **App.config** file settings should look similar to the following:

    ![Screenshot of the App.config file setting. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](./media/image97.png "App.config file setting")

### Task 5: Test dynamic pricing in Simulator

1.  Before building the project in Visual Studio, we need to ensure all the NuGet packages are properly restored. In Visual Studio, go to **Tools-\>NuGet Package Manager-\>Package Manager Console** and enter the following command:

**Update-Package -Reinstall**

2.  That should force the packages to get downloaded again.

3.  Now, in Solution Explorer, right-click the Simulator project, and select **Build**.

4.  Ensure that your build generates no errors (View the Output and Errors windows, under the View menu in Visual Studio).

5.  Again, in solution explorer, right-click the Simulator project, and select Set as Startup Project.

    ![Screenshot of Solution Explorer, with Simulator selected, and in the sub-menu, Set as StartUp Project selected.](./media/image98.png "Solution Explorer")

6.  From the Debug menu, select Start Without Debugging.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Debug menu, with Start Without Debugging selected.](./media/image99.png "Debug menu")

7.  When the vending machine simulator appears, **select take picture** at the bottom.
    
    ![The Vending Machine Simulator displays the ad for coconut water for \$1.25.](./media/image100.png "Vending Machine Simulator")

8.  In the dialog that appears, navigate to the images folder under **C:\\VendingMachines\\VendingMachines - Clean\\Simulator\\images\\photos**, and pick the photo of either the man or woman to upload, and select Open.
    
    ![Screenshot of Open window, expanded to the photos folder where two images display: female.jpeg, and male.jpeg.](./media/image101.png "Photos folder")

9.  In a few moments, you should see the price change from \$1.25 to whatever value the predictive model suggested. 

    ![The Vending Machine Simulator now displays the coconut water price as \$0.91.](./media/image102.png "Vending Machine Simulator")

10. Try using the other photo or your own photo to see what prices are suggested.

11. Click the X at the top right of the application to stop it.

## Exercise 4: Implement purchasing

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will create an in-memory, columnar index table in SQL DB that will be used to support purchase transactions in a real-time analytics fashion, and then implement the purchasing process in the vending machine simulator. Finally, you will run the simulator and purchase items.

### Task 1: Create the transactions table

1.  Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the SQL Scripts folder and open the file Create Table.sql.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Solution Explorer expanded to Create Table.sql.](./media/image103.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

    TransactionId int IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,
    ```

3.  Replace TODO 2 with the following:
    ```
    TODO: 2. This table should have a columnar index
    INDEX Transactions_CCI CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE
    ```

4.  Replace TODO 3 with the following:
    ```
    TODO: 3. This should be an in-memory table
    MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON
    ```

5.  Replace TODO 4 with the following:
    ```
    TODO: 4. In-memory tables should auto-elevate their transaction level to Snapshot
    ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_ELEVATE_TO_SNAPSHOT=ON;
    ```

6.  Save the script.

7.  Execute the script by pressing the play icon.

    ![Play button arrow](./media/image104.png "Play button arrow")

8.  Expand **Azure**, and if prompted, sign in with your Azure credentials.

9.  From the Azure node, and select the database you created for the vending database. 

    ![Screenshot of the Connect window. Azure is expanded, and vending (vendingmachineslab) is circled.](./media/image105.png "Connect window")

10. In the in fields at the bottom, enter your user name and password for the SQL Server, and select Connect. The script should run successfully.

    ![Screenshot of the Query executed successfully message.](./media/image106.png "Query executed successfully message")

### Task 2: Configure the Simulator

1.  In the Simulator project, open **App.config**.

2.  Within the **connectionString** section, set the following:

    -   TransactionsModel: set the value of the connectionString attribute to the ADO.NET connection string to your SQL DB instance. This value was copied to a text editor previously, or you can copy it from the Azure Portal. **Do not forget to replace the values for {your\_username} and {your\_password} with your actual credentials.**

        i.  User name: demouser

        ii. Password: Password.1!!

1.  Save the **App.config**. 

    ![The App.config file is shown in Visual Studio with the updated connection string to the database.](./media/image107.png)

### Task 3: Test purchasing

1.  In solution explorer, right-click the Simulator project, and select Build. Note: You may need to ensure the previous instance you started has been closed before rebuilding.

2.  Ensure that your build generates no errors.

3.  From the Debug menu, select **Start Without Debugging**.

4.  In the Simulator, select buy.
    
    ![The Vending Machine Simulator displays the ad for coconut water for \$1.25, with a buy button.](./media/image100.png "Vending machine simulation")

5.  You should see a confirmation dialog similar to the following:\
    
    ![Screenshot of the Purchase Complete dialog box, with the message \"Enjoy!\"](./media/image108.png "Purchase Complete dialog box")

## Exercise 5: Implement device command and control

    //TODO: 1. Receive messages intended for the device via the instance of _deviceClient.
    Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.Message receivedMessage = await _deviceClient.ReceiveAsync();
    ```

5.  Replace TODO 2 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO: 2. A null message may be received if the wait period expired, so ignore and call the receive operation again
    if (receivedMessage == null) continue;
    ```

6.  Replace TODO 3 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO: 3. Deserialize the received binary encoded JSON message into an instance of PromoPackage.
    string receivedJSON = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(receivedMessage.GetBytes());
    System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceInformation("Received message: {0}", receivedJSON);
    PromoPackage promo = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<PromoPackage>(receivedJSON);
    ```

7.  Replace TODO 4 with the following:
    ```
    //TODO: 4. Acknowledge receipt of the message with IoT Hub
    await _deviceClient.CompleteAsync(receivedMessage);
    ```

8.  Save the file.

### Task 2: Send control messages

1.  Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the **DeviceControlConsole** project, and open the file **Program.cs**. 

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Solution Explorer, with DeviceControlConsole expanded, and Program.cs circled.](./media/image111.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2.  Scroll down to the PushPromo method. 

    ![PushPromo method](./media/image112.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

3.  Replace TODO 1 with the following:

    ```

5.  Save Program.cs.

### Task 3: Configure the DeviceControlConsole and the Simulator

1.  In **DeviceControlConsole**, open **App.config**.

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Solution Explorer, with DeviceControlConsole expanded, and App.config circled.](./media/image113.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2.  Set the **IoTHubConnectionString appSetting** to have a value of the connection string for the service policy to your IoT Hub. (Recall you can get this from the Azure Portal IoT Hub blade, Shared access policies, and then select the policy.)

    ![Screenshot of the iothubowner blade. A callout points to the copy button to the right of the connection string - primary key field.](./media/image40.png "iothubowner blade")

3.  Set the **storageConnectionString appSetting** to have the same connection string for your storage account that the **App.config** file in the Simulator project has.

4.  Save the file.

5.  Now, open the **App.config** file In the Simulator project.

6.  Set the **IoTHubSenderConnectionString appSetting** to have a value of the connection string for the device policy to your IoT Hub.

7.  Set the **IoTHubManagerConnectionString appSetting** to have a value of the connection string for the **iothubowner** policy to your IoT Hub.

8.  Save the file.

9.  Build the Simulator and DeviceControlConsole projects.

10. In Solution Explorer, right-click Solution 'Vending Machines,' and select Set StartUp Projects.

    ![Screenshot of the Vending Machine Simulator and DeviceControlConsole. This time, the Vending Machine Simulator displays the soda ad.](./media/image117.png "Vending Machine Simulator and DeviceControlConsole")

16. Observe that the entire promotion surface of the vending machine changes (product name, price, and image).

**Note:** If the photo does not change, and after a few minutes you receive a DotNetty.Transport\... error, you will need to delete and recreate your IoT Hub in the Azure portal. The error is caused by a communication error between the application and your IoT Hub. Be sure to update your App.config file with the new IoT hub connection strings.

17. Experiment sending the other promotion or toggling between promotions.

18. Experiment with making purchases and sending photos to verify the other functions still work with the new promoted products.

## Exercise 6: Analytics with Power BI Desktop
